# Metro App
This is a practice project which is trying to build an app for metro user 
With following functionalities
  * User can Register
  * Allows the user to add, see, recharge their metro card
  * User can purchase QR ticket or pass and use it in metro station without human interaction.
 The app is built in such a way that it can be used for any transportation with minimum tweaks and configuration changes.
 
 The goal of this project is to practice the all-new skills which I have learned, build an app with clean code, and follow good practices suggested by google.
 And build an app with good-looking and user-friendly UI/UX.
